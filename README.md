# CollegeC-Project2

this simple C++ code does the following : 

    a DecToBin function that converts a number from Decimal to Binary
    a leap_year function that checks whether a year that a user enters is leap or not.
    a Palindrome function that checks whether a number that a user enters is a palindrome number or not.
    
that is all. Enjoy :p
